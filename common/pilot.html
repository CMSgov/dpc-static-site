<h1 id="about-the-pilot">About the DPC Pilot</h1>

<div>
  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Data at the Point of Care (DPC) API is currently in a pilot phase in which a limited number of customers can access Medicare Fee-For-Service claims data through the API once their solution has been approved for production. This pilot program promotes the industry-standard HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), specifically the Bulk FHIR specification.
</div>

<div>
  Since the pilot is a learning experience for both CMS and customers, participants in the pilot program may encounter breaking changes to code, iterations to regulations, and will be asked to participate in research sessions with CMS as the program continues to grow and evolve.
