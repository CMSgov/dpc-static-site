<h1 id="about-the-pilot">About the DPC Pilot</h1>

<div>
  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Data at the Point of Care (DPC) API is currently in a pilot phase in which a limited number of customers can access Medicare Fee-For-Service claims data through the API once their solution has been approved for production. This pilot program promotes the industry-standard HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), specifically the Bulk FHIR specification.
</div>

<div>
  Since the pilot is a learning experience for both CMS and customers, participants in the pilot program may encounter breaking changes to code, iterations to regulations, and will be asked to participate in research sessions with CMS as the program continues to grow and evolve. 
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Healthcare Organizations:</strong><br />
  Connect with your Health IT team
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Health IT Implementers:</strong><br />
  If interested in implementing DPC on behalf of healthcare organizations, please begin by following the steps below.
</div>

<h1 id="test-api">Test the API</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    Request access to the DPC Sandbox Environment through <a href="https://sandbox.dpc.cms.gov/users/sign_in" target="_blank" rel=noopener>Sandbox Sign Up / Login.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload synthetic data from DPCâ€™s public <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/dpc-app/tree/master/src/main/resources" target="_blank" rel=noopener>GitHub repository</a>. More details included in this <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/dpc-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/README.md">README</a> file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop and test a solution in the sandbox environment using synthetic data.
  </li>
</ol>
Reference the following guides to get started:
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://dpc.cms.gov/docsV1" target="_blank" rel=noopener>DPC Documentation</a>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ol>


<h1 id="apply-for-production">Apply for Production Credentials</h1>

After developing and testing a DPC solution in the sandbox environment, complete the steps below.

<h2 id="join-prod-queue">1. Request to Join the Production Pilot Queue</h2>

When you're ready to request production access, please <a href={{ site.email_register }} target="_blank" rel=noopener>email</a> the DPC Team. You will receive a follow-up email from the DPC Team when it is your turn to onboard.


<div class="ds-c-alert ds-c-alert--warn" role="region">
  <div class="ds-c-alert__body">
    <span class="ds-c-alert__a11y-label ds-u-visibility--screen-reader">
      Warning:
    </span>
    <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
      Please do not plan to fill out the application unless your organization has tested your solution in sandbox and is able to share security documentation with CMS.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="demo-dpc">2. Schedule a Demonstration with the DPC Team</h2>

After you request production access, you will receive an email about scheduling a demonstration of your DPC solution with the DPC Team.

<div class="usa-accordion usa-accordion--bordered" id="how-to-prepare-for-demo">
  <h2 class="usa-accordion__heading" id="accordion__demo-prep">
    <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="x1">
      How can I prepare for the demo?
    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="x1" class="usa-accordion__content">
    Please be prepared to answer the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Walk us through the end-to-end workflow.
        <ul>
          <li>
            How do you attribute patients to practitioners?
          </li>
          <li>
            How will practitioners see the data in your system?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        How frequently will your organization make requests to the API? How quickly will you need the data returned?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is your retry logic for requests that fail?
      </li>
      <li>
        What will you do if you do not receive data back for some of the requested patients? For example, data for patients outside of the 18-month lookback period for a given provider will not be returned during early phases of the pilot.
      </li>
      <li>
        How will the data be used? For example, are you using the data for aggregate population reporting, or for insights into the needs of an individual patient? Or both?
      </li>
      <li>
        Where does the application live? 
      </li>
      <li>
        Would there be a separate instance if you bring on another practice during the pilot?
      </li>
      <li>
        During onboarding, we'll be providing keys directly to the practitioner organization to grant access to production via secure email - we will not be using the same web portal as our sandbox environment. Please consider how to best communicate with the practitioner to securely transfer secrets if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Are you ready for breaking changes during the pilot program?
      </li>
      <li>
        As we introduce new features into the pilot program, how will you incorporate those changes into your solution?
      </li>
      <li>
        How did you test your DPC solution? What documentation did you use the most?
      </li>
      <li>
        How much time do you anticipate needing for testing and QA between obtaining production access and putting data in front of your providers?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="upload-security-cred">3. Provide Security Certification</h2>

<div>
  Prior to onboarding to the production environment, you must provide one of the accepted security certifications below:
