        When will onboarding and new applications start again?
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <p>We've paused on taking applications for production data and onboarding existing applicants. This is temporary while we make improvements to our ID verification and onboarding process. We'll refresh our <a href="/updates.html">updates page</a> when onboarding and applications resume. We'll also post an announcement in our Google Group. In the meantime, the <a href="https://sandbox.dpc.cms.gov/users/sign_in">sandbox environment</a> is still available for testing.</p>

        How can I get more information?
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="a2" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <ul>
        <li>Technical documentation is available in the <a href="/docsV1.html">API Documentation</a>.</li>
        <li>A DPC Google Group has been created to provide answers to questions and to support providers and developers who are implementing Data at the Point of Care.</li>

        How is the Data at the Point of Care pilot program different from Blue Button 2.0 and Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA)?
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <ul>
        <li>Blue Button 2.0 provides FHIR-formatted data for one individual Medicare beneficiary at a time, to registered applications with beneficiary authorization. See <a href="https://bluebutton.cms.gov/">https://bluebutton.cms.gov/</a>.</li>
        <li>BCDA provides FHIR-formatted bulk data files to Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations (MSSP ACOs) for all of the beneficiaries assigned to a given ACO. See <a href="https://bcda.cms.gov/">https://bcda.cms.gov/</a>.</li>
        <li>Data at the Point of Care provides FHIR-formatted bulk data files to fee-for-service providers for their active patients as needed for treatment purposes under HIPAA. With DPC, providers identify their own rosters of patients to track, and no action is required from the beneficiary to authorize sharing of data. Data is shared between covered entities for treatment purposes as defined under HIPAA.</li>

    <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content">
      <ul>
        <li>Usefulness of the data to evaluate how helpful CMS claims data is for impacting treatment, provider burden, and quality of care for Fee-for-Service (FFS) providers at the point of care</li>
        <li>Ease of implementation for vendors and providers to evaluate how easy it is to configure and get started with requesting and receiving claims data</li>
        <li>Practicality and effectiveness of attribution logic that determines which providers can request and receive claims data for which patients and for how long</li>
        <li>Ease and effectiveness of ways that vendors and providers can collaborate to access the data</li>
        <li>Measure of the frequency of use and an evaluation of performance in different use cases to determine infrastructure decisions</li>

    </h2>
    <div id="a5" class="usa-accordion__content">

        <li>Data at the Point of Care secures Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and has multiple layers of protection, such as encryption in transit and at rest, security certification requirements of connecting vendors, auditing and analytics to look for suspicious activity, terms of service restrictions, public and private security keys, and IP address restriction.</li>
