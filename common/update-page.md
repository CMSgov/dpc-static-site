## Temporary pause on onboarding for DPC pilot
The Data at the Point of Care (DPC) API supplements patients' health records with data from Fee-For-Service (FFS) Medicare claims. The API is currently in a pilot with an initial group of participants. As an outcome of collaboration and feedback from this pilot group, the DPC team is implementing an improved authorization and onboarding experience. During this process, we've paused onboarding to DPC. **We'll provide an update in July of 2023** with more information on the length of the pause and changes to the onboarding process.

Here's how the temporary pause may affect you:

**If you're interested in DPC, but haven't requested access**

Please join us in the [Data at the Point of Care community](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dpc-api). We'll provide regular updates there, including the date when onboarding will resume.

**If you've requested access to the API and are waiting to onboard**

We really appreciate your patience and can't wait to onboard you into the pilot. If you've requested access to DPC, and we've confirmed receipt of your request, you'll keep your current place in the onboarding queue.

**If you're an existing pilot participant**

You can continue using the DPC API. We'll let you know if there are any re-authorization steps required of you.

Thanks to all of you for your participation, patience, and interest!
