## Temporary pause on onboarding and applications for DPC pilot
The Data at the Point of Care (DPC) API supplements patients' health records with data from Fee-For-Service (FFS) Medicare claims. Thanks to collaboration and feedback from our initial pilot group, we're implementing an improved onboarding experience. During this process, **we've paused onboarding and new applications to DPC**. We'll provide an **update** in **July of 2023** on the length of the pause and changes to the onboarding process.

Here's how the temporary pause may affect you:

**If you're interested in DPC, but haven't submitted an application**

We are not taking new applications for production data during the pause. However, you can still request access to the sandbox. We also encourage you to join the [Data at the Point of Care community](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dpc-api). We'll provide regular updates there, including the date when onboarding will resume.

**If you've requested access to the API and are waiting to onboard**

We really appreciate your patience and can't wait to onboard you into the pilot. If you've requested access to DPC, and we've confirmed receipt of your request, you'll keep your current place in the onboarding queue.

**If you're an existing pilot participant**

You can continue using the DPC API. We'll let you know if there are any re-authorization steps required of you.

Thanks to all of you for your participation, patience, and interest!
