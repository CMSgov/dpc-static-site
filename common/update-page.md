## Temporary pause in onboarding and new applications for production data
Data at the Point of Care (DPC) supplements patients' health records with data from Fee-For-Service (FFS) Medicare claims. Thanks to feedback from our initial pilot group, we're implementing an improved onboarding experience. During this process, we've paused onboarding and accepting new applications for DPC production data. We'll provide an update in July of 2023 on the continuing timeframe and any changes to the onboarding process.

Here's how the temporary pause may affect you:

**If you're interested in DPC, but haven't submitted an application for production data**

We are not taking new applications for production data during the pause. However, you can still [request access to the sandbox](https://sandbox.dpc.cms.gov/users/sign_up). We encourage you to join the [Data at the Point of Care community](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dpc-api). We'll provide regular updates there, including the date when onboarding will resume.

**If you've requested access to the API and are waiting to onboard**

We really appreciate your patience and can't wait to onboard you into the pilot. If you requested access to DPC, and we confirmed receipt of your request, you'll keep your place in the onboarding queue.

**If you're an existing pilot participant**

You can continue using the DPC API. We'll let you know if any re-authorization steps are required.

Thanks to all of you for your participation, patience, and interest!
