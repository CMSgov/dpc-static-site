# Data at the Point of Care
A static Jekyll site for the DPC welcome, FAQ, and documentation pages.

## Requirements
It is assumed that the environment already has these installed:

- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to install versioned ruby.
- [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) currently using 2.7.1
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) currently using 4.2.0
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) currently using 6.13.4
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to standardize builds across all contributors' local machines
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to define and run multi-container Docker applications

## Installation
Navigate to the repository and install the appropriate Gem file and `package.json` file.

(A Gem file includes the dependencies for Ruby apps.)

1. `gem install bundler` <— install Gem bundler
2. `bundle install` <— install Gem bundles
3. `npm install` <— install `package.json` dependencies
4. `make install-git-hooks` <— install git-hook(s)

## Local builds
Jekyll builds the CSS and HTML pages. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the project root for a local build. By default, the site will run in `http://localhost:4000/`. You can also run `bundle exec jekyll build` to compile the site files into the `_site` directory.

### Using Docker for distributed builds
Every contributor that uses Docker will have the exact same build as every other contributor. The command for a consistent and simple build process is:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build static_site
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run --rm static_site
```

This process uses a Docker container to execute `bundle exec jekyll build`, compiling site files into the same `_site` directory used when executing this command on the Docker host. The advantage here is that there's no need to install ruby or any dependencies on the machine building the static site—Docker takes care of all that.

### Using Docker for serving
To host the site in Docker, accessible at `http://localhost:4001/`:

```
docker-compose run --publish 4001:4000 --rm --entrypoint "bundle exec jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0" static_site
```

This is a convenience meant to ease integration of static site builds with the larger DPC CI/CD pipeline.
