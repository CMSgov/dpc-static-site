        As patients move throughout the healthcare system, providers often struggle to gain and maintain a complete picture of their patients’ medical history. Data at the Point of Care (DPC) aims to fill these gaps in care with Medicare Fee-For-Service claims data to inform providers with secure, structured, and standardized data for improved quality of beneficiary care.

            A 68 year old Medicare beneficiary Maria recalls getting the first dose of her shingles vaccine at her local pharmacy earlier this year, but she can't quite remember when she went. Her provider uses data from DPC to see when Maria got her shot, and if she's ready for her second dose.

      <div class="ds-u-padding-bottom--3">
        The DPC Pilot starts with Health IT implementers, who are asked to test and develop a solution with the DPC API using synthetic data in the sandbox environment before applying for access to Medicare Fee-For-Service claims data in production. The DPC sandbox and production environments are subject to breaking changes throughout the pilot phase as DPC incorporates research findings and user feedback.
      </div>
      <div>
        The DPC API leverages the industry-standard <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html" target="_blank" rel=noopener>HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>, which allows providers and integrators to incorporate Medicare claims data into the Health IT software and clinical workflow. This allows a timely and standardized reference of data that is accessible to all who are involved in a beneficiary’s care.

        How can I get my healthcare organization involved?
      </h1>
      <div class="get-involved-info">
        Providers at healthcare organizations can get involved by using the Provider resources below. In order to receive claims data for your Medicare beneficiaries, the DPC API requires a partnership between providers and their Health IT team to develop and design a solution that seamlessly integrates with your Health IT software. This capability empowers providers to request claims data directly through the Health IT software and gain insight into patient records within the existing workflows utilized at the point of care.
