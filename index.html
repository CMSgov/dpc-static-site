        As patients move throughout the healthcare system, providers often struggle to gain and maintain a complete picture of their patientsâ€™ medical history.  Data at the Point of Care (DPC) aims to fill these gaps in care by providing Medicare Fee-For-Service claims data to providers in a structured and standardized format.

        Providers at healthcare organizations can get involved by using the provided resources below. In order to receive claims data for Medicare beneficiaries, the DPC API requires a partnership between providers and their Health IT team to develop and design a solution that seamlessly integrates with  the Health IT software. This capability empowers providers to request claims data directly through the Health IT software and gain insight into patient records within the existing workflows utilized at the point of care.
