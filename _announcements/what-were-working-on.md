The DPC pilot has revealed ways to improve the onboarding experience and enhance the verification of organizations accessing Medicare enrollees' data. We've also identified ways to automate steps that are currently manual. While onboarding is paused, we're addressing these needs by:

- Adding additional security by changing the way credentials are assigned
- Improving validation with the [Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS)](https://pecos.cms.hhs.gov/pecos/login.do#headingLv1)
- Adding automation to make onboarding faster and easier

Onboarding and new applications can start up again when this work is complete. We'll provide future updates here and in the [Data at the Point of Care community](https://groups.google.com/g/dpc-api).
